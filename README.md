# ALIENS-R-REAL - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

This is a project that requires creating a basic HTML [web page](https://ushaakumaar.github.io/ALIENS-R-REAL-JavaScript-DOM-Manipulation/) using the [UFO dataset](static/js/data.js) provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects.

## Programming Language / Applications - Used

  * HTML
  * D3.JS, DOM Manipulation
  * CSS
    - Bootstrap

## Automatic Table and Date Search
* Created a basic HTML web page using [index.html](index.html) file.
* Using the [UFO dataset](static/js/data.js) provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote D3 JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

## Multiple Search Categories
* Using additional select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
